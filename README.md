# IoT Smart Home Development Using Wemos D1 and ThingSpeak
This project demonstrates how to create an IoT-based smart home LED control system using the Wemos D1 microcontroller and the ThingSpeak platform. With this setup, you can control an LED remotely via the internet, monitor its status, and explore further automation possibilities.

## Overview
This project allows users to control an LED connected to a Wemos D1 microcontroller using the ThingSpeak IoT platform. ThingSpeak provides an easy way to send and receive data over the internet, enabling seamless control of IoT devices.

## Features

- Remote LED control via ThingSpeak.

- Real-time monitoring of LED status.

- Easy-to-implement setup using Wemos D1.

- Expandable to include multiple devices and sensors.

## Components
- Wemos D1 Mini (or any ESP8266-based board)

- LED

- Resistor (220Ω)

- Breadboard

- Jumper wires

- Micro-USB cable

## Circuit Diagram

- Connect the components as follows:

- Connect the positive leg (anode) of the LED to D4 (GPIO2) on the Wemos D1 via a 220Ω resistor.

- Connect the negative leg (cathode) of the LED to GND on the Wemos D1.
